  Physical IN Â» (XBee) Serial OUT
  
  Wireless multi-node machine inspired by "Rube Goldberg Machine" 
  Project for ITP Class Understanding Networks by Tom Igoe

  Physical object is waitin for a collision, that is triggered by a simple pushbutton.
  Following code is based off the de-bouncing code. Once triggered, it
  will send a serial (wireless through Xbee) message to the next node
  in the Rube Goldberg network.
